# Introduction to R

These materials are intended for an audience completely new to coding. They take users from setting up a project in R to data manipulation with `dplyr` and graphing with `ggplot2`. I opted for .R files instead of .Rmd based on the philosophy that seeing pure code is easier to process than code + markdown formatting at the same time. The full contents are as follows:

## Part 1
* Why should we code?
* Setting up a project and organizing files
* R as a calculator
* Variable assignment
* Control flow: if/else
* Control flow: for/while
* Functions
* Coding best practices

## Part 2
* Installing and attaching packages
* Loading datasets
* Data manipulation with `dplyr`
* Graphing with `ggplot2`
* Basic statistical analyses: t-test, linear regression
* Troubleshooting advice
