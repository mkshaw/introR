# Introduction to R

These materials are intended for an audience new to coding. They take users from setting up a project in R to data manipulation with `dplyr` and graphing with `ggplot2`. I opted for .R files instead of .Rmd based on the philosophy that seeing pure code is easier to process than code + markdown formatting at the same time. The full contents are as follows:

## Part 1
* Why should we code?
* Setting up a project and organizing files
* R as a calculator
* Variable assignment
* Control flow: if/else
* Control flow: for/while
* Functions
* Coding best practices

## Part 2
* Installing and attaching packages
* Loading datasets
* Data manipulation with `dplyr`
* Graphing with `ggplot2`
* Basic statistical analyses: t-test, linear regression
* Troubleshooting advice

## Setting Up R
Before using these materials, you should download both R and RStudio. Briefly, R is the programming language itself and RStudio is software that makes it easier to code in R and organize your files.

Download R first, then RStudio.

Links for downloading R:
* For Mac users: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/macosx/ 
* For Windows users: https://cran.r-project.org/bin/windows/

## Additional Resources

This is not an exhaustive list of additional resources, but provides some immediately useful materials following the content of the two introductory sessions.
